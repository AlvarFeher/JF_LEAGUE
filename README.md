# JF League Manager

**JF League** is the name of one of my most recent hobbies, playing football with friends. 

We are the same group always and every week we do random teams. 

The JF League manager is our **Fantasy League** app, in which we record our stats (goals, assists, faults, saves) and manage the matches.

## **Future Improvements**
- Agentic LLM implementation for Balanced Teams generation based on the current stats

## **Stack**

Built with Next.js (React), Firebase, FastAPI, Python, LangChain
