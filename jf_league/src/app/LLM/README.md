# AGENTIC LLM TESTING

this is a test to implement an agentic LLM model to the JF LEAGUE app

its purpose is to suggest balanced teams based on the stats provided and allow the user to ask for adjustments

also, it would be cool if it could be funny xd

first it will run my local LLM from Ollama with langchain. later on I will change it to GPT's API
